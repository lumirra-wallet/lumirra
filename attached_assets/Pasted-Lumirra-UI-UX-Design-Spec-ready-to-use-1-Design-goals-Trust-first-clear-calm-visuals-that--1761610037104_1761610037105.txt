Lumirra — UI / UX Design Spec (ready-to-use)
1) Design goals

Trust-first: clear, calm visuals that communicate security and value.

Simple onboarding: make seed creation & backup the hero flow.

Scannable dashboards: balances, recent txs, and quick actions up front.

Cross-platform parity: same visual language on Mobile (React Native) + Web (React).

2) Core user flows (prioritized)

Onboard (New user) — Welcome → Create wallet → Show seed → Confirm seed → Set PIN/biometric → Wallet home.

Restore wallet — Welcome → Restore with mnemonic → Biometric/PIN → Home.

Send funds — Home → Send → Enter recipient / scan QR → Select asset → Adjust gas/fee → Confirm → Broadcast → Receipt.

Receive funds — Home → Receive → Show address + QR + copy → Optional “verify on device”.

Add custom token — Tokens → Add token → Paste contract → Fetch metadata → Confirm.

Connect dApp — Connect request via WalletConnect → Permission modal → Sign request → Confirmation.

Swap — Swap tab → Select pair → Fetch quote → Preview gas & slippage → Confirm → Receipt.

Account settings — Security (change PIN, manage seed), Nodes, Export logs (for support), About.

3) Screen list + wireframe notes (mobile-first)

I. Splash / Welcome

Logo centered (diamond + bold L), tagline, “Create Wallet” and “Restore Wallet” CTAs.

Small “Have an existing seed?” link.

II. Create Wallet — Seed display

Big safe-looking card with 12/24 words, copy & download buttons, “I wrote it down” checkbox.

Visual cue: diamond watermark in background.

Secondary CTA: “Hide seed” toggles for privacy.

III. Confirm Seed

Randomized word-selection test (3–4 words); success shows “Backup complete”.

IV. PIN & Biometric Setup

PIN entry (4-6 digits) + “Enable biometric” toggle.

V. Home / Dashboard

Top: total portfolio value (local currency), chain selector (dropdown).

Middle: horizontal token cards (swipeable) for each token: icon, name, balance, fiat value.

Quick-actions row: Send · Receive · Swap · dApp.

Recent transactions list with status badges (pending/confirmed/failed).

Floating Action Button (FAB) for primary action (Send).

VI. Send Flow (multi-step)

Step 1: recipient input (address/ENS/search/QR). Validate checksum.

Step 2: asset & amount. Show fiat conversion inline.

Step 3: fees editor: suggested (fast/normal/slow) + manual advanced gas slider.

Step 4: review modal: show diamond emblem, big amount, recipient, fee, network. “Swipe to confirm” or big Confirm button.

Step 5: success screen with TX hash copy/share button.

VII. Receive

QR modal with address, copy & share, optional message.

VIII. Token Details

Token header with big icon, balance, price chart (7d), send/receive buttons, token info tab (contract, decimals, holders).

IX. Swap

Pair selector with searchable dropdown, price impact & slippage warning, quote results with aggregator source, confirm & success.

X. Settings

Security: change PIN, export logs, app lock timeout.

Network: manage RPC lists, custom RPC add.

About & legal: privacy policy, terms, contact support.

500: #94A3B8

Elevation / shadows

Soft card shadow: rgba(4, 12, 20, 0.04) 0px 4px 12px

Strong modal shadow: rgba(4, 12, 20, 0.12) 0px 12px 24px

Typography

Diamond emblem as unique app mark — provide SVG & PNG (48, 72, 96, 128, 256 px).

Spacing scale (rem-based)

4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64

5) Component library (atomic)

Provide components in Figma/React (Tailwind-ready):

App Bar — chain selector + profile menu + hamburger.

Card — token card with icon, balance, fiat conversion.

Primary Button — filled rounded (height 44px), primary color.

Secondary Button — outline.

FAB — circular, 56px, shadow.

Input — single-line, with validation states & copy icon.

Modal — centered, with header, body, footer CTAs.

Toast — success/error messages.

Transaction row — icon, label, amount, timestamp, status badge.

Gas slider — presets + manual slider.

Mnemonic display — tokenized word chips (selectable for confirm).

QR modal — scannable large QR, copy & share.

6) Micro-interactions & motion

Onboarding seed reveal: subtle upward reveal + shimmer on each word to encourage focus.

Button press: 98% scale with quick easing.

Transaction success: confetti particle (subtle) + success toast.

Network switch: small modal with network icon, elastic dropdown.

Swipe to confirm (optional): tactile, with progress fill and haptic.

(Animation durations: 120–240ms for micro interactions; 400–600ms for full-screen transitions.)

7) Accessibility & localization

Text contrast >= 4.5:1 for body, >=3:1 for large text.

Support dynamic type on mobile; responsive font scaling on web.

All controls reachable by keyboard; labels present for screen readers.

Localize strings (i18n), format currencies with Intl API, store language resources.

8) Dark mode

Primary: Lumirra Blue on dark surfaces uses lighter tints.

Use subtle card elevations and soft glows for diamond emblem.

Ensure QR and address copy contrast in dark theme.

Icon set: 24px / 32px / 48px PNG + single-page SVG sprite.

Fonts: host via Google Fonts (Inter) or self-host variable fonts for app.

Color tokens: JSON theme for devs, e.g.

{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#1677FF",
    "text": "#0B1320",
    "bg": "#FFFFFF",
    "success": "#2ECC71"
  }
}


Spacing & typography: export as Tailwind config or design tokens (JSON) for direct use.

10) Developer handoff (what to include in PRs)

Figma link (or zipped design file).

Token JSON + Tailwind config.

Component library docs (props, variants, states).

Example screen snapshots + asset folder.

Accessibility checklist & test cases.

11) Example UI text / microcopy (copy-ready)

Pages: 1) Design System, 2) Wireframes (low-fi), 3) High-fidelity screens, 4) Interactions (prototype).

Deliverables: Figma file with components, responsive variants, exported PNG/SVG assets, and a clickable prototype for onboarding + send flow.
